Project Title: **Basic Calculator in Java**

**Project Overview:**
This project involves developing a simple Java program that functions as a basic calculator. The program is designed to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes input from the user for two numbers and the desired operation, then computes and displays the result.

**Key Features:**

**User Input:**
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It then asks the user to choose an arithmetic operation from a given menu.

**Operations:**
Addition (+): Adds the two numbers and displays the result.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first and displays the result.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies the two numbers and displays the result.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second and displays the result. If the second number is zero, it handles the error gracefully by displaying an appropriate message.

**Input Validation:**
Ensures the user selects a valid operation from the menu.
Handles division by zero error to prevent program crashes.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
Clear prompts guide the user through the input process.
Results are displayed in a straightforward manner.

**Technologies Used:**
Java: The primary programming language used for developing this application.
Scanner Class: Utilized for taking user input from the console.
Conditional Statements: Used for performing different operations based on user input.
Switch Case: Used for executing different arithmetic operations based on user choice.

**Conclusion:**
This Basic Calculator project is a fundamental yet essential exercise for anyone learning Java. It provides hands-on experience with basic programming constructs, user input handling, and arithmetic operations. By completing this project, I have strengthened my understanding of Java and improved my problem-solving skills. This project marks a significant step in my journey as a Java developer during my internship at CODTECH IT Solution.
